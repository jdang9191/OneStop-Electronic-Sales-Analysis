2. **Implement targeted promotions**:  
   - Use **seasonal discounts** on essentials (chargers, headphones)  
   - Offer **free shipping** to encourage conversions  
   - **Bundle high-AOV items** (Macbook, ThinkPad) with accessories using a **‚ÄúBuy More, Save More‚Äù** model  
3. **Investigate refund drivers**:  
   - High refund rates for premium items suggest product issues or customer dissatisfaction  
   - Coordinate with product/QA teams to resolve
