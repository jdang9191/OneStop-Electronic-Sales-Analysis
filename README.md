## Executive Summary  
From **2019 to 2022**, OneStop Electronics generated over **$28 million in sales revenue**, processing more than **108,000 orders**. The **average order value (AOV)** across all years stands at **$260 per order**.

In **2020**, the company saw significant year-over-year growth, with:

- **Sales revenue** increasing from **$2M to $10M**  
- Substantial increases in order volume and engagement across all tracked metrics

March 2020 had the highest growth rates, with a 50% growth rate in sales and 46% increase in number of orders.

Following 2020, sales dropped tremendously, with revenue steadily decreasing month by month. OneStop Electronics experienced a decline in YoY (Year over Year) growth with revenue dropping by 10% in 2021 and decreasing even further to 45% the following year. October 2022 was the worst month with a 55% decrease in revenue.

The loyalty program, first introduced in 2019, shows room for promising growth. While customers not in the loyalty program initially outperformed loyalty members in sales, trends started to reverse in recent years. Through further improvement and optimization of the loyalty program, sales, number of orders, and AOV could increase and drive future growth.
