This will enable reliable access to refined data for analysis and reporting.

## Executive Summary  
From **2019 to 2022**, OneStop Electronics generated over **$28 million in sales revenue**, processing more than **108,000 orders**. The **average order value (AOV)** across all years stands at **$260 per order**.

In **2020**, the company saw significant year-over-year growth, with:

- **Sales revenue** increasing from **$2M to $10M**  
- Substantial increases in order volume and engagement across all tracked metrics

March 2020 had the highest growth rates, with a 50% growth rate in sales and 46% increase in number of orders.

Following 2020, sales dropped tremendously, with revenue steadily decreasing month by month. OneStop Electronics experienced a decline in YoY (Year over Year) growth with revenue dropping by 10% in 2021 and decreasing even further to 45% the following year. October 2022 was the worst month with a 55% decrease in revenue.

The loyalty program, first introduced in 2019, shows room for promising growth. While customers not in the loyalty program initially outperformed loyalty members in sales, trends started to reverse in recent years. Through further improvement and optimization of the loyalty program, sales, number of orders, and AOV could increase and drive future growth.

## Regional Trends
/graphs/customer demographic.png 
Most customers come from North America, **66%** of customers are from North America and account for **51%** of total sales.
The top 10 countries in sales revenue account for approximately **77%** of sales. Ranked by sales revenue, these countries are the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Germany, Australia, Brazil, France, Spain, and the Netherlands.
From these top 10 countries, Japan leads with the highest AOV (**$393**), followed by the Netherlands (**$289**) and Germany (**$270**). Spain has the lowest AOV (**$223**) of these 10 countries.

## Loyalty Program
Initially, customers not in the loyalty program outperformed loyalty members in sales by a wide margin. In 2019, loyalty members generated a mere **$415k $207 AOV** in sales revenue compared to **$3.4M $233 AOV** from members not in the loyalty program. Additionally, in 2020, loyalty members generated approximately **$3M $228 AOV** in 2020 while customers not in the loyalty program generated **$7.1M $345 AOV**. 

However, trends have started to reverse following 2020, with the loyalty program doing better in all metrics compared to non-loyalty members. Loyalty member AOV has steadily risen and overtook non-loyalty AOV in 2022. 

## Refund Rates
/graphs/refund metric.png 
Macbook Air Laptop and Thinkpad Laptop lead the product lineup with an **11%** refund rate.
24in 4k Gaming Monitor (**1445**) and Apple Airpod Headphones (**2636**) had the most number of orders refunded.
Macbook Air Laptop (**$746,365**) and 24in 4k Gaming Monitor (**642,719**) had the highest amount of revenue from sales refunded.

## Recommendations
Based on the following analysis and insights, the following is suggested.

1. Remove Bose Soundsport from the product lineup. It does not generate enough sales and has performed poorly every year in every metric.
2. Implement discounts and promotions in months where metrics are down. Consider seasonal promotions such as:
      Discounting essentials (chargers, headphones, etc.) and using free shipping to boost order volume
      Incentivizing high-AOV purchases (Macbook Air Laptop, Thinkpad Laptop) by using bundled discounts with items like webcams and monitors. Use a "Buy More, Save More" strategy to increase AOV.
3. Investigate with the product team to determine why refund rates for the highest-AOV items(Macbook and Lenovo) are so high.
